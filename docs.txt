1) If you have indicated a need for programming support on the Tools & Support step, an additional Programming step will appear to capture the additional information needed by the programming team.
2) Select the customer area. Please note that an automated email will be generated and sent to the Additional Programming Support Manager based on which Customer Area is selected. In cases in which “External Vendor” is selected for additional programming support, you will be prompted to identify an Additional Programming Support Manager by entering in his or her the Merck email address
3) Select all that apply. Selecting "Other" will display a text box for more information.
4) Provide the GTT MCode (Merck Global Time Management System Project Code).
5) Indicate the programming start date.
6) Indicate the target delivery date (this is the date by when deliverables are needed).
7) List all expected programming languages needed for the analysis (e.g. JupyterHub, R, Other). Note that this field will be auto-populated with “SAS”.
8) List all expected deliverables and quantity of each (this is a multi-select field).
9) PRS and Table Shell listing templates can be downloaded from the linked Study Automation Template Selector.
10) Indicate protocol status. Please note that this should be marked as “Approved” for all CORE NIS
11) Upload any protocols and study concept sheets or other supporting documentation. Please, note that if you upload attachments and don't submit the analysis, attachments will be lost and you will need to re-upload them again next time you access your Draft Analysis.
12) Click to return to the previous step.
13) Proceed to the next step in the wizard. If any required fields were left empty, they will highlighted and must be completed before proceeding.
