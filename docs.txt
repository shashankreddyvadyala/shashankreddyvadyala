It seems like you’ve outlined a very structured and organized directory and file management system for conducting and storing analysis projects. This is a comprehensive approach to ensure that code, data, and outputs are systematically arranged, version-controlled, and easily accessible to all team members. Here’s a summary and additional considerations:

1.1.1 adhoc/
Purpose: A flexible space for experimental and temporary files not requiring version control.
Movement: If any code in this folder is finalized, it should be transferred to the code/src folder.
1.1.2 code/
Version Control: All code is version-controlled via Bitbucket.

Accessibility: Only contributors have access, and the Support Team can grant additional access or delete repositories.

Structure: Contains subfolders for configuration, libraries, source code, study files, and utilities.

1.1.2.1 conf/
Contains configuration or property files.
1.1.2.2 lib/
Stores custom macros for the analysis.
1.1.2.3 src/
Used for statistical programming and analysis.
1.1.2.4 study_files/
Houses documentation, SOPs, and other related study files.
1.1.2.5 utility/
Contains common procedures for analysis.
1.1.3 input/
Purpose: Store all input files needed for analysis.

Structure: Contains subfolders for raw data, processed data, and reference materials.

1.1.3.1 data_raw/
Holds preliminary/raw input datasets.
1.1.3.2 data_processed/
Contains intermediary datasets.
1.1.3.3 ref/
Stores lookup files, data dictionaries, and codes.
1.1.4 output/
Purpose: Place where all analysis output files are stored.

Structure: Contains subfolders for data, graphics, logs, list files, and tables.

1.1.4.1 out_data/
Houses datasets generated from code.
1.1.4.2 out_graphics/
Stores graphics or visualizations.
1.1.4.3 out_logs/
Holds logs from code execution.
1.1.4.4 out_lst/
Contains data list files.
1.1.4.5 out_tables/
Stores exportable datasets.
Additional Considerations:
Backup and Recovery: Consider incorporating a backup and recovery mechanism to safeguard against accidental data loss.
Documentation: Document the purpose and content of each folder extensively to guide current and future team members.
Automation: Explore automation tools to streamline the code deployment, data management, and version control processes.
Security: Implement stringent security protocols to protect sensitive data and code.
Review and Cleanup: Regularly review the ‘adhoc’ and other folders to clean up obsolete or redundant files.
This directory structure ensures a neat and organized workflow, promoting collaboration, traceability, and reproducibility in data analysis projects.
